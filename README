# Overview

Created this tool so that I could create custom Power Equilab ranges and easily quiz myself until it becomes second nature.

# Configure

1. Download http://power-equilab.com/
2. Set up your ranges in Power Equilab

3. Copy your PreflopPredefined.ini in your PowerEquilab folder to root
   - ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Power-Equilab\PreflopPredefined.ini to PokerRangeQuizzer\PreflopUserDefined.ini
   - A sample GTO 6max-no-ante range is included in the repository.

# Run

1. Within src, "python main.py"
2. There are 3 ways to select the range(s) to quiz:
   - ![](img/ranges.PNG)
   1. Enter a single number
      1. ex: "71" to test against the 6max-No-Ante:Vs_RFI:BB:v_HJ_3b range
   2. Enter a range of numbers
      1. ex: "71-79" to test against 9 ranges
   3. Enter a comma-dilemeted list of numbers
      1. 71,72 to test against the two ranges
3. For this example, I selected "1" for 6max-No-Ante:Opens:BU

4. Enter 1, 2, 3 indicating the frequency for Jh-5s given the range of 6max-No-Ante:Opens:BU
5. 1 was correctly selected
